# Eric Lake Portfolio Project
- This project was completed as the week 2 challenge for DU Bootcamp
- Live page: https://yohuck.github.io/du-bootcamp/challenge-2

## Key Features
- Responsive hamburger navigation for small screenm sizes
- Built-in-CSS custom fabric & patch effects
- Responsive sections for bio information, portfolio work, and contact links
- Custom CSS patch effect for project stack information

## To-Do
- My font & color variables started out organized, but they need to be set to the final color and font schemes and updated throughout the code for better organization
- I will add additional items to the work section as I create more projects.
